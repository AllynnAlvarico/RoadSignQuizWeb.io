# Road Sign Quiz Web

Welcome to Road Sign Quiz Web, a project designed to help users prepare for their driving tests by learning and recognizing road signs. This website is currently under development and serves as both a resource for driving test preparation and a practice project to enhance my web development skills.



# Motivation

Road Sign Quiz Web is a project where Iâ€™m learning two things at the same time: road signs to prepare for driving tests and web development to further my programming skills. The signs on this site are based on [National Driving School Ireland's Road Signs Guide](https://nationaldrivingschool.ie/road-signs-ireland/). 

While searching for a website to help with driving test preparation, I realized there was a lack of accessible and interactive resources tailored for this purpose. I also found it hard to stay engaged and remember each sign just by looking at static lists. This got me thinking, maybe if I built an interactive platform while practicing programming, I could absorb the information better and make the process more enjoyable.

This platform is both an educational tool for users(like me) and a space for me to practice and grow as a web developer.
