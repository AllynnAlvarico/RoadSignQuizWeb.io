# Road Sign Quiz Web

Welcome to Road Sign Quiz Web, a project designed to help users prepare for their driving tests by learning and recognizing road signs. This website is currently under development and serves as both a resource for driving test preparation and a practice project to enhance my web development skills.



# Motivation

While searching for a website to help with driving test preparation, I realized there was a lack of accessible and interactive resources tailored for this purpose. To fill this gap, I decided to create my own platform that focuses on road sign education and quizzes.

The road signs included on this site are based on reliable information from National Driving School Ireland's Road Signs Guide.

# Features

- **Interactive Quizzes**: Test your knowledge of road signs through engaging quizzes.
- **Road Sign Categories**: Explore a variety of road signs, including warning signs, regulatory signs, and information signs.
- **Educational Content**: Learn about road signs with descriptions and visual aids.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Frameworks and libraries (if any) will be added here as the project evolves.
- Planned
	- Angular
	- Tailwind CSS
	- TypeScript

## Development Status

This project is a work in progress, and more features will be added in the future. 
Current goals include:
-  Improving quiz functionality.
-  Enhancing the UI/UX design.
-  Adding more road signs and detailed explanations.
