# Road Sign Quiz Web

Welcome to Road Sign Quiz Web, a project designed to help users prepare for their driving tests by learning and recognizing road signs. This website is currently under development and serves as both a resource for driving test preparation and a practice project to enhance my web development skills.



# Motivation

While searching for a website to help with driving test preparation, I realized there was a lack of accessible and interactive resources tailored for this purpose. To fill this gap, I decided to create my own platform that focuses on road sign education and quizzes.
Road Sign Quiz Web is a project where I’m learning two things at the same time: road signs to prepare for driving tests and web development to further my programming skills. The signs on this site are based on National Driving School Ireland's Road Signs Guide. This platform is both an educational tool for users and a space for me to practice and grow as a web developer.

The road signs included on this site are based on reliable information from National Driving School Ireland's Road Signs Guide.

# Features

- **Interactive Quizzes**: Test your knowledge of road signs through engaging quizzes.
